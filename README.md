# DX11Engine
This project is a small custom 3D game engine which I am building to create small games and AI prototypes in the future.        
The project uses DirectX11 as graphics API. I am also using the DirectXTK SDK https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK
to speed up implementation of some systems.

# Game Project: Nightmare Keep
I am building a First Person Dungeon Crawler in my custom engine! This is a passion project meant to showcase my abilities as an AI, gameplay, and graphics programmer.
Since I am building everything from scratch there is a lot of linear algebra involved in the graphics shaders, as well as my collision functions and some of the gameplay features to be added. I am also very careful with my memory management for this project to ensure a smooth user experience.


__Disclaimer:__
All assets being used in development are not uploaded into the repo. This project also has some dependencies which will prevent proper linkage in other machines.
As I am a solo developer this is not an issue to me, but I understand the complications that may arise from these decisions.
If interested in viewing the project, keep an eye on my portfolio site where I make updates on my progress. https://juliodelgado19.wixsite.com/website
